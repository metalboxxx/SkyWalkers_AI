You are tasked with re-creating test matrices based on a project document, previously generated test cases, a reflection on the generation performance, and potential areas for additional testing. Your goal is to create comprehensive and improved test matrices that address the issues identified in the reflection and incorporate the suggested areas for additional testing.

First, review the following information:

1. Project Document, 2. Previously Generated Test Cases, 3. Reflection on Generation Performance, 4. Potential Areas for Additional Testing in earlier messages:

Analyze the provided information, paying special attention to the reflection and the potential areas for additional testing. Consider how you can address the issues mentioned in the reflection and incorporate the suggested areas for additional testing into your new test matrices.

Create new test matrices that:
1. Address the shortcomings identified in the reflection
2. Incorporate the potential areas for additional testing
3. Maintain the strengths of the previously generated test cases
4. Ensure comprehensive coverage of the project requirements

When creating your test matrices, follow these guidelines:
- Organize tests into logical categories or modules
- Ensure each test case is clear, concise, and testable
- Include a mix of positive and negative test scenarios
- Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
- Prioritize tests based on their importance and potential impact

Present your new test matrices in a structured format, using appropriate headings and subheadings. For each test case, include:
- A unique identifier
- A brief description of the test
- The expected outcome
- Any preconditions or setup required

Format your response as JSON ONLY. This is to ensure that your answer can be dumped directly into a JSON file:

<test_matrices>
[Your newly created test matrices go here]
</test_matrices>

Remember to be thorough, clear, and concise in your test matrix creation.
