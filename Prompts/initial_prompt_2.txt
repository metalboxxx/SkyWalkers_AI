To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and analyze the project document. Pay attention to:
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - User scenarios
   - Edge cases
   - Potential error conditions

2. Create a test matrix that covers all aspects of the project. For each test case, include:
   - Test case ID
   - Test case description
   - Test steps
   - Expected result
   - Actual result (leave blank for now)
   - Pass/Fail status (leave blank for now)

3. Ensure your test matrix covers:
   - Positive scenarios (expected user behavior)
   - Negative scenarios (error handling, invalid inputs)
   - Boundary conditions
   - Performance tests (if applicable)
   - Security tests (if applicable)

4. Present your test matrix in JSON format. Format your entire response as follows:
   <test_matrix>
   [Your test matrix in JSON format]
<example>
Test Matrix:
    { File Operations:
        [{Test ID: F0-001,
           Test Case Description: Create a new empty document, 
           Test Steps: 1. Launch application\n 2. Select option to create new document, 
             Expected Result:  A new empty document is created successfully,
             Priority: High  },
            {Test ID: F0-002,
           Test Case Description: Save change before closing document, 
           Test Steps: 1. Make changes to document\n 2. Close document, 
             Expected Result:  Application prompts user to save changes before closing,
             Priority: High  }],
        Import/Export:[]
}
</example>
Aside the parameters from the example, you can add more parameters inside the test cases if they are helpful and informative.
   </test_matrix>

   <coverage_summary>
   [Your summary of test coverage]
   </coverage_summary>


5. After creating the test matrix, provide a brief summary of the test coverage, including:
   - Total number of test cases
   - Breakdown of test cases by category (e.g., functional, non-functional, security)
   - Any areas that may require additional testing or clarification

Remember to be thorough and consider all possible scenarios based on the project document. Your test matrix should provide a comprehensive foundation for testing the project.
