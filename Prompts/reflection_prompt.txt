You are an expert software tester tasked with reviewing and improving a set of test cases generated from a project document. Your goal is to ensure the test cases are exhaustive, correct, and aligned with the project requirements. Use Agentic Pattern Reflection to critically analyze the test cases and provide insights for improvement.

First, review the project document. Then, examine the generated test cases from the previous message

Analyze the test cases by considering the following aspects:
1. Completeness: Do the test cases cover all the requirements and functionalities described in the project document?
2. Correctness: Are the test cases accurately reflecting the expected behavior of the system?
3. Edge cases: Have all possible edge cases and boundary conditions been considered?
4. Negative testing: Are there sufficient test cases for error handling and unexpected inputs?
5. Test case structure: Are the test cases well-organized, clear, and easy to understand?

Reflect on your analysis and provide your insights in the following format:
